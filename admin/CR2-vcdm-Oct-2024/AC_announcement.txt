Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 05 November 2024

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20240511/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/

Abstract:
Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's 
licenses are used to assert that we are capable of 
operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used 
to assert our level of education, and government-issued 
passports enable us to travel between countries. This 
specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts 
of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically 
secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 05 November 2024

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-data-integrity-20240511/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/

Abstract:
This specification describes mechanisms for ensuring the 
authenticity and integrity of Verifiable Credentials and 
similar types of constrained digital documents using cryptography, 
especially through the use of digital signatures and related 
mathematical proofs.

Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 05 November 2024

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-eddsa-20240511/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite
for use when creating or verifying a digital signature using the 
twisted Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) 
and Curve25519 (ed25519).

Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for
use when generating a digital signature using the Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
