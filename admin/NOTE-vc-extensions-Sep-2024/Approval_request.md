# Abstract

This document serves as an unofficial directory for all known Verifiable Credential specifications whether they are released by a global standards setting organization, a community group, an open source project, or an individual.

# Status of the Document

See: https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-vc-extensions-20240910/#sotd

# Link to group's decision to request transition

See https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2024-08-21-vcwg#section4-2

Note that this is not a new document; the decision was to rename an already existing WG Note, namely the [VC Specifications Directory](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-specs-dir/). The necessary redirections will have to be made at the time of publication.

# Is it intended to be a W3C Statement?

No.
