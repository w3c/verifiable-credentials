Dear Denis,

Here are the necessary information for the publication.
    Document Title: Controller Documents 1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-vc-controller-document-20240523/ (doc already in place)
    Publication Date: 2024-05-23
    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/610
        Director's approval state: approved in
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/610#issuecomment-2115832187
Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes
    Pass Link Checker's check: 

    beyond the usual problems the link checker complaints about a fragment ID: 
    
        https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/#securing-mechanisms

    which, however, works from the browser. I am not sure why link checker complains.

The publication should be tagged as "Security", and "Privacy".

Thank You

Ivan
