Denis, Jiaying,

As you could see in [1], there is a transition request for a REC, with a publication planned for the 3rd of March. Hopefully we will get the approval of Philippe and Ralph in time.

I have already put the document on TR space:

https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/

and the editors of the document (the lead editor, Manu Sporny, is cc-d) have gone through
the pubrules' checker. However, we would appreciate if you could check the document whether
it is ready for publication, or whether we have to make some editorial changes.

Of course, as soon as we get the transition approval, I will send you (i.e., the webmaster) an official
publication request, will send the drafts for the REC AC announcement to Xueyuan.

Thanks

Ivan
