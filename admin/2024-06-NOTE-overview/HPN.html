Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Working Group Note: Verifiable Credentials Overview

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">VC Working Group</a> 
    has just published a Working Group Note:
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-vc-overview-20240613/">Verifiable Credentials Overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor
    vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to
    travel between countries. The family of W3C Recommendations for Verifiable Credentials, described in this overview
    document, provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically
    secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
