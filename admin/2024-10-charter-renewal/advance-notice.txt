Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group chairs]

This is an advance notice that the Team is currently working on a 
revised charter for the Verifiable Credentials Working Group:
    https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/455

with the current proposal available at:
     https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/

The current charter of the Working Group expires in June 2024. The
Group has published a number of Candidate Recommendations, and is
currently busy finalizing the test suites and collecting implementation
information. The revised charter has therefore two goals:

1. Give time to the Working Group to finalize the Recommendation 
   track documents. The goal is to publish them in January 2025.
2. Set up a maintenance course for the Recommendations they are published. 

Accordingly, the scope of the proposed new charter is identical
to the current charter, except for the following additional paragraph:

    "Once all the planned Recommendations have been published, the Working 
    Group will continue in maintenance mode to handle errata. No new 
    Recommendations are planned. Class 4 changes for Recommendations published 
    by the Working Group are out of scope, except if serious security issues 
    come to the fore that require changes in a Recommendation."

We welcome input and feedback on the draft charter. If you wish to make 
your comments public, you're welcome to raise comments at:
   https://github.com/w3c/vc-wg-charter

W3C Members may also discuss on the member-confidential mailing list 
<w3c-ac-forum@w3.org> [1]. We also welcome your general expressions of 
interest and support on that mailing list.

A formal Advisory Committee Review for this charter is expected mid May.

If you should have any questions or need further information, please 
feel free to contact Ivan Herman <ivan@w3.org>, Team Contact for the 
Verifiable Credentials Working Group.

This announcement follows section 4.1 of the Process Document:

Thank you,

For Philippe le HÃ©garet, W3C Strategy and Project Lead;
