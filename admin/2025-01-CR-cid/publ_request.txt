Dear Denis,

This is an official publication request for a CR snapshots for Thursday, 30th of January, 2025:

    Document Title: Controlled Identifiers (CIDs) v1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/CR-cid-1.0-20250130/
    Publication Date: 2025-01-30

    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/691
        Director's approval:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/691#event-16059131024

The publication also includes a change of short names. The new short name "cid-1.0" replaces the one used for
the Working Drafts, namely "controller-document". The necessary modifications on the source have been made

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes, except for the references to the short name change. I presume this is a issue with the
    checking process
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes (apart from the issues to be expected with the new status and short name)

Xueyuan, Coralie, I will send you drafts for the HPN and the AC announcement in separate mails.

Thank You

Ivan
