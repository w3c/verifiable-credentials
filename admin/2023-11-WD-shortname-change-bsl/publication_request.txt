Denis,

this is an official publication request for a W3C Working Draft:

Title: Bitstring Status List v1.0
Publication Date: Thursday 23 November
Short name: vc-bitstring-status-list
URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-bitstring-status-list-20231123/ 
(the document is already in place).

Although a Working Draft, and the WG uses Echidna, this out-of-band
publication request is necessary because the WG intends to change the earlier short name
from `vc-status-list` to`vc-bitstring-status-list`. The previous document is:

https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-status-list-20230427/

Along the lines of an earlier change I tried to follow what is [1], ie,
to add a data attribute to the history item. However, as we have already seen in [2],
respec still does not behave as expected, so I followed your earlier 
instructions in [3] (related to another document) and added a new
item in the history header part explicitly. I hope that will do it.

Philippe, I am not sure whether there is a need for a separate TiLT approval for such a change. There is 
definitely no issue template for something like that in the transition github repo, and I did not see
any precedence either. If there is a need for an approval, could you give it, so that the webmaster could
proceed?

Thanks

Ivan
