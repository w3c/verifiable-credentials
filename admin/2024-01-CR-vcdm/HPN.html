Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 is a Candidate Recommendation (Call for Implementations)

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">VC Working Group</a> invites implementations 
    of the following Candidate Recommendation Snapshot: 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20240201/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert 
    that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be 
    used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to
    travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these
    sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, 
    privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
