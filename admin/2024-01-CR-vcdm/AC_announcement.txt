Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 1 February 2024

Abstract:
Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's 
licenses are used to assert that we are capable of 
operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used 
to assert our level of education, and government-issued 
passports enable us to travel between countries. This 
specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts 
of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically 
secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
