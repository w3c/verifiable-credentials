This document is special as it is, essentially, an editorial spin-off from other CR documents published by the Working Group, namely the [Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/) and [Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/). The two document had lots of texts, terms, concepts in common, which have been removed into this document to serve as a common reference. No new feature has been added. This also means that the horizontal reviews on those two documents apply to this document as well.
