Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group Chairs]

W3C is pleased to announce the re-charter of the Verifiable Credentials Working Group:
    https://www.w3.org/2024/10/vc-wg-charter.html

The group is chartered through 11 October 2026.

The mission of the Verifiable Credentials Working Group is to complete and 
maintain the W3C Recommendations, as well as related Notes, in the area of Verifiable 
Credentials, published under the previous charter of the Working Group.

Please use the following form to have your organization join the group. 
The form will also instruct you how to nominate participants:
    https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/join/

Current participants do not need to rejoin the group.

Please consider diversity when proposing people to participate in W3C 
groups. Representation from a wider group of people, especially people 
from under-represented groups, is vital for creating web standards that 
meet the needs of the wider web community.

The group chair is Brent Zundel (mesur.io). The Team Contact is 
Ivan Herman, 0.20FTE.

More information about the group can be found on the group home page:
