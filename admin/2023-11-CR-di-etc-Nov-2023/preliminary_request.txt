Dear Denis,

This is a preliminary publication request for four CR snapshots:

    Document Title: Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-data-integrity-20231107/
    Publication Date: 2023-11-07

    Document Title: Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-eddsa-20231107/
    Publication Date: 2023-11-07

    Document Title: ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-ecdsa-20231107/
    Publication Date: 2023-11-07

    Document Title: Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema Specification
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-json-schema-20231107/
    Publication Date: 2023-11-07

    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/573
        Director's approval state: expected...

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes.


On the link checker results:

- in the data integrity spec, one gets:

Lines: 2975, 4782 https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/Status: 200 OK
https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/#proof (line 2975)

These are broken because the link checker doesn't run ReSpec before searching
for fragments. The link works when you bring it up in a web browser.

- there are some errors on linked-in URLs that do not allow robots. The links have been checked in the browser and they are o.k.

- there is a common error report to all:

    Line: 349 https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice
    Status: 302 -> 200 OK

This link is added by respec, it is a bit out of our hands...

Xueyuan, as before, the Abstracts in the documents are quite simple, and it is good enough for a HPN news. Ping me
if you prefer me to send a draft.

Thank You

Ivan
