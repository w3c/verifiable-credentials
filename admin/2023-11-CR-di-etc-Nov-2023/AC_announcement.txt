Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 21 November 2023

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-data-integrity-20231121/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/

Abstract:
This specification describes mechanisms for ensuring the 
authenticity and integrity of Verifiable Credentials and 
similar types of constrained digital documents using cryptography, 
especially through the use of digital signatures and related 
mathematical proofs.

Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 21 November 2023

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-eddsa-20231121/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite
for use when creating or verifying a digital signature using the 
twisted Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) 
and Curve25519 (ed25519).

Status of this document:
https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-eddsa-20231121/#sotd

Data Integrity ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 21 November 2023

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-di-ecdsa-20231121/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/

Abstract:
This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for
use when generating a digital signature using the Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema Specification
W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 21 November 2023

This version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-vc-json-schema-20231121/
Latest published version:
   https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-json-schema/

Abstract:
Among other things, the [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0] specifies the models
used for Verifiable Credentials, Verifiable Presentations, and
explains the relationships between three parties: issuers,
holders, and verifiers. Verifiability, extensibility, and 
semantic interoperability are critical pieces of functionality
referenced throughout the [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]. This specification
provides a mechanism to make use of a Credential Schema in
Verifiable Credential, leveraging the existing Data Schemas concept.
