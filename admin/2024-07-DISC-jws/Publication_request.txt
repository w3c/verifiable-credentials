Dear webmaster,

Here are the necessary information for the publication.

    Document Title: JSON Web Signature for Data Integrity Proofs - W3C Discontinued Draft
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/DISC-vc-jws-2020-20240702/ (doc already in place)
    Publication Date: 2024-07-02
    WG Resolution for discontinuing:
        https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-15-vcwg#resolution1

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes, except for one error: the system flags one of the editors, namely Orie Steele, 
    not to be part of the WG. Which is correct, but he was part of the WG when the last
    version of the draft was (erroneously) published as a Working Draft (stating that the
    document is discontinued). If possible, I would prefer to keep his name on the spec. 
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes.

Thank You

Ivan
