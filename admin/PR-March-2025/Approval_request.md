# Requirements satisfied

Yes.

# Dependencies met (or not)

All normative dependencies for all documents are either RECs or IETF RFCs, except for:

* VC-JOSE-COSE: which depends on SD_JWT (@@@ Exact IETF terminology to say that it is in "PR" and technically stable@@@@).

# Wide Review

For the official horizontal reviews: all documents have been checked, possibly several times at CR transitions. A series of review calls have also been issued for the more complex specifications:

## Horizontal reviews

On December 15 a series of horizontal review requests were issued, covering 7 documents, making it clear that this is a request on a Proposed Rec in preparation, focussing on the changes since CR. Here are the results:

* [TAG](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1029) no response, consider it as timed out
* [Privacy](https://github.com/w3cping/privacy-request/issues/153) no response, consider it as timed out
* [Security](https://github.com/w3c/security-request/issues/81) discussed with SING, see also [summary](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2025-02-06-vcwg#section1) on a VC Call
* [A11y](https://github.com/w3c/a11y-request/issues/99), properly [approved](https://github.com/w3c/a11y-request/issues/99#issuecomment-2612618858). There is a minor issue on how to refer to the appropriate WCAG document, which is also an APA problem; if resolved after Rec, this can be taken care of as part of the Maintenance work.
* [I18n](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-request/issues/255) partially [approved](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-request/issues/255#issuecomment-2544027079) but timed out since.

## Other wide review

With respect to wide review, changes to each specification has been circulated on a weekly basis to the W3C Credentials Community Group, which contains over 560+ individuals, with a number of them providing continued feedback since the CR phases. A recent example:

https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Feb/0018.html

The test suites run on a weekly basis and implementers actively track how their implementations are performing. Ecosystem reports are also available and are tracked and commented on by organizations adopting vendor solutions:

Note that the list has been, unfortunately, polluted what can be considered as a spam. This has been cross checked by the legal team and determined that the PR is indeed bogus, with unknown persons/company referring to an old radiotelephone systems issue that is totally irrelevant to VC. The decision is that it can be ignored, see:
