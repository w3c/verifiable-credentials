# Wide Review of substantive changes

None of the substantive changes since CR1 are related to Accessibility, Internationalization, Architecture, or Privacy. Some Security-related changes have been made, but the Security review is pending the creation of Security Interest Group. We have written to each group above to get confirmation on if they concur with our analysis.

With respect to wide review, changes to the specification are circulated on a weekly basis to the W3C Credentials Community Group, which contains over 560+ individuals, with a number of them providing continued feedback since CR1. For example:

https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2024Oct/0031.html

The test suites run on a weekly basis and implementers actively track how their implementations are performing. Ecosystem reports are also available and are tracked and commented on by organizations adopting vendor solutions:

Multiple implementers have also reviewed changes and have confirmed that they will implement or plan to implement all substantive changes since CR1.

# Formal Objections

None

# Any changes in implementation information?

Two more implementations have been added to the test suite since CR1, bringing the total implementations registered in the VCDM v2.0 test suite to seven (7):

...and the total number of VCWG implementations to fourteen (14): 

https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite-implementations/tree/main/implementations

The discrepancy is due to some implementers focusing on implementation of the Data Integrity test suites (more difficult) over the VCDM v2.0 test suite (easier).
