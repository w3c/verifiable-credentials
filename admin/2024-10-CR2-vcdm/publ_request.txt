Dear Denis,

This is an official publication request of a CR snapshot for Thursday, 19th of December, 2024:

    Document Title: Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20241219/
    Publication Date: 2024-12-19

    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/658
        Director's approval:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/658#issuecomment-2541464429

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes. (Note that the checker does report errors, but they are all false positive,
    including the fragment issues on github.io documents: all links work from a browser.)

Xueyuan, I will send you drafts for the HPN and the AC announcement in separate mails.

Thank You

Ivan
