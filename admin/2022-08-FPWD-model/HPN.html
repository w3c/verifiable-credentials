<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> has published a First Public Working Drafts today for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-vc-data-model-2.0-20220811/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0</a>. This specification provides a mechanism to express credentials (driving license, university degree, vaccination documents, etc.) on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

<p>
    This First Public Working Group Draft is, essentially, identical to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1</a> Recommendation, published by the Working Group in March 2022. It is a starting point for the development of what will become the next major revision of the technology.
