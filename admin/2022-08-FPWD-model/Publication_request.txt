Dear webmaster,

Here are the necessary information for the publication.
    Document Title: Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-vc-data-model-2.0-20220811/

This is a FPWD, but it is also a continuation of

    https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/

as such, it should be tagged as "Security", and a "version 2" for the /TR collection (just like the the earlier document above).

An additional request of the WG is to set up a series of redirections, once the FPWD is published, as follows:

1. Set up a new shortname, namely vc-data-model-1.1, referring to the stable 1.1 specification , ie, https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/ (the one which, today, is known as https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model).

2. The new vc-data-model-2.0 will be the short name for the 2.0 version of the data model.

3. The (current) vc-data-model would be redirected to `vc-data-model/latest` (the 'CR+' approach), i.e.,

	3.1. point at https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/ as long as the new specification is in WD
	3.2. point at the version 2.0 when that one becomes a CR

4. If possible, as a possible cherry on the cake: set up a new shortname, namely vc-data-model-1.0, referring to the first version i.e., https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-vc-data-model-20191119/

(If (4) is not possible, it is not a problem. Just ignore the request.)

Thank You

Ivan
