<p>
    The VC Working Group invites implementations of the following Candidate Recommendation
    Snapshot:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-jose-cose-20240425/">Securing Verifiable 
        Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>. This specification defines how to secure credentials and presentations
        conforming to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credential data model</a> 
        with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</a>, 
        <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt">Selective Disclosure for JWTs</a>, 
        and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052">CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)</a>. This enables the Verifiable
        Credential data model to be implemented with standards for signing and encryption that are widely adopted.
    </li>
</ul>
