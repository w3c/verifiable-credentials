Dear webmaster,

(This is an official publication request for two publications by the same WG; they were submitted as a FPWD separately, 
and there were separate preliminary publications requests but, as the publication date is the same, I thought
it would be simpler to have one official request.)

Here are the necessary information for the publication.

    Document Title: Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-jwt-20230427/ (doc already in place)
    Publication Date: 2023-04-27
    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/500
        Director's approval state: approved in
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/500#issuecomment-1519227123

    Document Title: Verifiable Credentials Status List v2021
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-status-list-20230427/ (doc already in place)
    Publication Date: 2023-04-27
    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/501
        Director's approval state: approved in
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/501#issuecomment-1519226924

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes for both
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes for both.

The publications should be tagged as "Security", and "Privacy".

Xueyuan, as before, the Abstracts in the documents are quite simple, and it is good enough for a HPN news. Ping me
if you prefer me to send a draft.

Thank You

Ivan
