# Wide Review of substantive changes

Changes to each specification has been circulated on a weekly basis to the W3C Credentials Community Group, which contains over 560+ individuals, with a number of them providing continued feedback since CR1. For example:

https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2024Oct/0031.html

The test suites run on a weekly basis and implementers actively track how their implementations are performing. Ecosystem reports are also available and are tracked and commented on by organizations adopting vendor solutions:

Multiple implementers have also reviewed changes and have confirmed that they will implement or plan to implement all substantive changes since CR1.
