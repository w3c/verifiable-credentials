Dear Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of a Working Group Note for Thursday, 17st of September, 2024.

    Document Title: Verifiable Credential Extensions
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-vc-extensions-20240917/
    Short Name: vc-extension

    This document is, in fact a change of short name, and the previous title and short names was:

    Document Title: Verifiable Credential Extensions
    Latest URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-vc-specs-dir-20240915/

    Hence the explicit publication request (we use echidna otherwise)
     
    I have modified the history entry of the new version by adding the 'data-previous-shortname="vc-specs-dir"' attribute. 
    I have also requested an approval for the new short name:

    Record of publication request:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/654
    Transition approval:
        https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/654#issuecomment-2353227801

AFAIK, no announcement is necessary, so I did not include Xueyuan and/or the comm team.

Thank You

Ivan
