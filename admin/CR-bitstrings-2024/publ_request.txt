subject: Publication Request: Bitstring Status List v1.0

Dear Denis,

This is an official publication request for a CR snapshots for Thursday, 9th of May, 2024:

    Document Title: Bitstring Status List v1.0
    Document URL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-bitstring-status-list-20240509/
    Publication Date: 2024-05-09

    Approvals:
        Record of publication request:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/603
        Director's approval:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/603#issuecomment-@@@@@@

Checks:
    Pass Pubrules' check: yes
    Pass Link Checker's check: yes.

The link checker reports three errors:

    • https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#section-3.1.1.5 (line 1968)
    • https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#section-6.5.13 (line 1973)
    • https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#section-5.3.2 (line 1967)

However, these links work properly in the browser (the html page does some redirection from one style of fragment ID-s to another).

Xueyuan, I will send you drafts for the HPN and the AC announcement in a separate mail.

Thank You

Ivan
