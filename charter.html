                <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
                <p>
                    In the past few years the Working Group has developed a family of specifications in the area of
                    Verifiable Credentials.
                    They provide a mechanism to express "credentials"
                    (driver's licenses, university degrees, government-issued residence permits, etc.) on the Web in a
                    digital
                    format that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
                    These technologies are being gradually adopted by various institutions, governmental and otherwise,
                    in different
                    countries around the globe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Readers that are new to this work should read the <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-overview/">Verifiable Credentials Overview</a> W3C Note,
                    published by the Working Group. The Note explains some of the terminology used in this charter,
                    e.g., Verifiable Credentials and Presentations, Data Integrity, and cryptosuites. It also provides a
                    technical overview of how the various specifications listed as
                    <a href="#deliverables">deliverables</a> relate to one another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The group should finalize all the <a href="#deliverables">specifications</a> started under <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/verifiable-credentials-wg-charter.html">its previous
                        charter</a>.
                    Once all Recommendations are published, this Working Group will maintain the complete family of
                    specifications and related notes.

                    The Working Group will complete the Recommendations listed <a href="#deliverables">below</a>, if
                    applicable.
                    Once all the planned Recommendations have been published, the Working Group will continue in
                    maintenance mode to handle errata. No new Recommendations are planned.

                        adequate consensus supporting their addition to the Recommendation.
                        At the time of writing this charter, these terms are:

                                This specification is a general framework to associate proofs of integrity for

                                and concrete serializations for each of the defined syntaxes.
                                The Working Group would welcome the usage of these techniques for data in general, but
                                its scope will be to solve Verifiable Credentials use cases. The specific set of
                                concrete serializations and cryptosuites appear as separate
                                specification, all part of the same family of specifications.

                <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR"
                        title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>,
                    each normative specification is expected to have <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at
                        least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the
                    specification, where interoperability can be
                    verified by passing open test suites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test
                    suite
                    that tests every feature defined in the specification.
                    Additionally, two or more implementations should demonstrate interoperability for each feature
                    by passing these open test suites, and by showing that these implementations may interoperate with
                    each other.
                    For example Verifiable Credentials produced by implementations must be consumed by other
                    implementations and behave as specified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A feature should be understood as a property or set of properties that are normatively required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy
                    implications for
                    implementers, Web authors, and end users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Working Group expects to follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">TAG Web

                    Invitation

                    The Working

                    development of each
                    specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and
                    is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a
                    specification following a
                    review.
                </p>

                    To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its
                    duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active
                    Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are
                    expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
                    requirement for other Participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document
                    repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their

                    This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list

                    The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the
                    discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when

                    Decision Policy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1
                        Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is
                    then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
                    little formal voting being required.</p>
                <p>
                    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
                    consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a
                    decision along with any objections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including
                    publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
                    provisional.

                    A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue
                    or web-based survey), with a response period of 1 week, depending on the chair's evaluation of the
                    group consensus on the issue.

                    If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to
                    have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information
                    becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
